features:
  - title: Type Safe
    icon: 🏰
    details: First and foremost Type Route strives for excellent TypeScript support. An API designed for static analysis not only means the compiler has your back but also enables your editor to provide intelligent hints and warnings as you code.
  - title: Flexible
    icon: 🚀
    details: Type Route was designed with excellent React integration in mind but isn't coupled to a specific UI framework. Use it with Vue, Svelte, Angular, Ember or anything else. There's even support for non-browser environments like React Native.
  - title: Solid Foundation
    icon: 🏛️
    details: The same core library behind React Router also powers Type Route. From this solid foundation Type Route adds a simple and flexible API optimized for a developer experience that is second to none.
